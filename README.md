This code is used to build, train, and evaluate a neural network model for predicting political orientation based on text data. The political orientation is labeled as either "Liberal" or "Conservative." The model uses TensorFlow and Keras for the neural network architecture, and the data is preprocessed using the TfidfVectorizer from the scikit-learn library.
